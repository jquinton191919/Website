<p>
The question above is a typical one asked by Christian Missionaries. The answer is easy, if one understands Jewish beliefs.

<p>
Jews do not believe that the Messiah is a part of G-d, or Divine in any way, more than any other person. Jews look only to G-d for our salvation, and when the time 
comes for G-d to bring the anointed king, then it shall happen. Jews do not concern ourselves with the messiah's identity, for the messiah is a person and the 
messiah's coming does not change our relationship with G-d. Jews do not accept the notion that Scripture "foretells" that G-d would robe Himself in flesh; in fact, 
to Jews, this idea is idolatry, and we stand against it.

<p>
The reason why Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah is straightforward: he did not meet the requirements in the job requisition! G-d outlined these requirements 
in the Bible. The key aspect of proof is in the state of the world. According to the Bible, amongst the most mission of the messiah includes returning the world to 
return to G-d and G-d's teachings; restoring the royal dynasty to the descendants of David; overseeing the rebuilding of Jerusalem, including the Temple; gathering 
the Jewish people from all over the world and bringing them home to the Land of Israel; reestablishing the Sanhedrin; restoring the sacrificial system, the 
Sabbatical year and Jubilee. This simply has not happened. Judaism has no notion of the messiah not doing these things on the first visit, let along needing a 
second visit to do these things. Whenever these things are described in the Tanakh, the description says that the messiah will come and do these things - once. 

<p>
Oh you want specifics? According to the Torah, the Messiah will:
<ol>
<li>Ezekiel 37:26-28: Build the Third Temple (besides saying that the Messiah will build the Third Temple, this chapter also details the exact dimensions that the
Third Temple would have - precluding the Third Temple from simply being an allegory in Christian tradition)
<li>Isaiah 43:5-6: Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel
<li>Isaiah 2:4: Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. 
"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore."
<li>Zechariah 14:9: Spread universal knowledge of the G-d of Israel - uniting the entire human race as one: "G-d will be King over all the world - on 
that day, G-d will be One and His Name will be One"
</ol>

Jesus fulfilled none of these messianic prophecies. Additionally:
<ul>
<li>Jesus was not a prophet. Prophecy could only exist in Israel when the land is inhabited by a majority of world Jewry. During the time of Ezra 
(~300 BCE) the majority of Jews refused to move from Babylon to Israel, thus prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets (Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi). 
Jesus appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended.
<li>Jesus was not descended from King David. Per Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1, the Messiah must be descended on his father's side from King David. However, 
according to the Christian claim that Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic 
requirement of being descended on his father's side from King David! The Christian idea of a virgin birth is derived from a verse in Isaiah describing an "alma" 
as giving birth. The word "alma" has always meant a young woman, but Christian theologians came centuries later and translated it as "virgin." This accords Jesus' 
birth with the first century pagan idea of mortals being impregnated by G-ds.

It's well established that all four gospels were written in Greek. The Septuagint (LXX) is a Greek language version of the Hebrew "Old Testament", which is more than
likely what Matthew was quoting from. Isaiah 7:14 in Hebrew reads "this young woman" while Isaiah 7:14 in the LXX reads "this virgin". In either case, Isaiah 7 is 
not a messainic prophecy, it's a chapter that deals with King Ahaz and his fear of the neighboring kingdoms. Isaiah wanted King Ahaz to wait for God to give him support instead of making alliances with Assyria.
See the history of <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=971&letter=A&search=ahaz" target="_blank">King Ahaz</a> in the Jewish Encyclopedia. 
<p>
Besides being literally written in Greek, a lot of Christianity's themes (gods impregnating mortals) are Greek in nature. Nietzsche called Christianity 
<i>"Platonism for the masses"</i>.
<p>
In response, it is claimed that Joseph adopted Jesus, and passed on his genealogy via adoption.
There are two problems with this claim:
<ol>
    <li>There is no Biblical basis for the idea of a father passing on his tribal line by adoption. A priest who adopts a son from another tribe cannot make him a 
	priest by adoption;
    <li>Joseph could never pass on by adoption that which he doesn't have. Because Joseph descended from Jeconiah (Mat. 1:11) he fell under the curse of that king 
	that none of his descendants could ever sit as king upon the throne of David. (Jeremiah 22:30; 36:30).
</ol>
<br>
To answer this difficult problem, apologists claim that Jesus traces himself back to King David through his mother Mary, who allegedly descends from David, as 
shown in the third chapter of Luke. There are four basic problems with this claim:
<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>There is no evidence that Mary descends from David. The third chapter of Luke traces Joseph's genealogy, not Mary's.
    <li>Even if Mary can trace herself back to David, that doesn't help Jesus, since tribal affiliation goes only through the father, not mother. Cf. Num. 1:18; 
	Ezra 2:59.

    <li>Even if family line could go through the mother, Mary was not from a legitimate Messianic family. According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of 
	David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14)
	<li>Luke 3:27 lists Shealtiel and Zerubbabel in his genealogy. These two also appear in Matthew 1:12 as descendants of the cursed Jeconiah. If Mary descends 
	from them, it would also disqualify her from being a Messianic progenitor.
</ol>
<br>
<li>Tradition teaches that the Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. Deut. 13:1-4 states that all mitzvahs remain binding forever, and 
anyone coming to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet. Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states its 
commandments are no longer applicable. (John 1:45 and 9:16, Acts 3:22 and 7:37)
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<span class="section">Redefining the Roles</span>
<p>
In Christianity, the role of the messiah was redefined in order to fit the man's career as written by his followers. As Jesus was said to have been resurrected, 
the Bible was examined with the purpose of finding evidence that the messiah would be killed without bringing peace to the world or redemption to Israel. There 
was therefore the expectation of a second coming, at which time Jesus would carry out the task expected of the messiah (because he obviously didn't do it the first 
time). This also required creation of an explanation for the first coming and its catastrophic end. The net result of all of this was to shift the function of the
 messiah from a visible level where it could be tested (as in Tanakh, what Christians call the "Old Testament") to an invisible level where it could not. As a 
 result of this reworking, the messiah's goal the first time around was changed from the redemption of Israel to the atonement for "original sin". A reworking of 
 Biblical themes.

<p>
<i>Psalm 22:17</i>
<p>
There were also mistakes with respect to Jesus's death and its foretelling.  Psalm 22:17 says, "Like a lion, they are at my hands and feet." The Hebrew word <i>ki-ari</i> 
(like a lion) is grammatically similar to the word "gouged." Thus Christianity reads the verse as a reference to crucifixion: "They pierced my hands and feet." Other
scholars have said that  Psalm 22:17 has the Hebrew word <i>ki-asi</i>, which would make this verse say "They bound my hands and feet". As for the events that led
up to the crucifixion:
<ol>
<li>First, the NT says that the trial was on a Friday, and that on the night before, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal with his disciples. Accordingly, that would 
mean that his trial was on the first day of Passover. Here is a violation of two legal principles -- his trial was not on a Thursday or Monday as required, and it 
was on a holiday when no trials whatsoever could be held.

<li>Second, there were no witnesses of a warning to Jesus and no witnesses of his actual crime. The NT account of his trial shows that he was convicted on his own 
testimony. This is a severe violation of the Torah.

<li>Third, there is no account in the NT of any call for defense witnesses. Both the second and third points violate Jewish Sahnedrin law in Deut 19:15.

<li>Fourth, the choice of execution methods violates Torah completely. If convicted for Sabbath violation or false prophecy, the appropriate punishment was stoning. 
Why use a Roman torture method that took days to kill the felon, if it did at all, and resulted in a mutilated corpse?

<li>Fifth, if the trial and execution were indeed held on Friday, there are several problems, including limited time for a trial, and limited time for the execution. 
A crucifixion on a Friday afternoon was certain to run over through Shabbat and then later. Assuming that the 120 judges of the Sanhedrin would have permitted a 
crucifixion (which is unlikely), one would doubt that they would have risked having Jesus die on the cross after the Sabbath began Friday night (the Sabbath is on
Saturday, not Sunday as later Christians have asserted. Even the word "Sabbath" is used to deonte "Saturday" in Spanish). Because of the 
Sabbath laws, they would have been unable to carry the corpse to a burial site, and leaving the corpse on the cross overnight would be a Torah violation.

<li>Finally, sixth, there is no record teaching that the court of that era was known to be reckless with the use of the death penalty. Yet, not only was Jesus 
crucified, but so were two petty criminals, according to the NT, and their crimes did not even justify the death penalty under Jewish law.
</ol>

<p>
<i>Isaiah 53</i>
<p>
Christians also claim that Isaiah 53 refers to Jesus. Actually, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing the exile and redemption of the 
Jewish people. The singular form is used because the Jews ("Israel") are regarded as one unit. 
In fact, Isaiah states no less than 11 times in the chapters prior to 
53 that the Servant of God is Israel. When read correctly, Isaiah 53 clearly [and ironically] refers to the Jewish people being "bruised, crushed and as sheep 
brought to slaughter" at the hands of the nations of the world. These descriptions are used throughout Jewish scripture to graphically describe the suffering of the 
Jewish people (see Psalm 44). Isaiah 53 concludes that when the Jewish people are redeemed, the nations will recognize and accept responsibility for the inordinate 
suffering and death of the Jews.


<p>
<i>Isaiah 9:5-6</i>
<p>
Christians also claim that Isaiah 9:5 predicts that the Messiah would be YHWH incarnate because of the phrase "And he will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace". 
This is due to a misinterperetation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophory_in_the_Bible" target="_blank">Theophoric Name</a>. The name "Elgibbor"
means "God [is] Mighty" (the variant is Gabriel, which has the same meaning), but the English translation implies that the Messiah will literally be a "mighty god".

The name Ahijah means "brother of Jah (YHWH)". There are numerous characters in the Tanakh with this name. 
<ul>
<li>Ahijah the Shilonite, the Biblical prophet who divided the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah. 
<li>One of the sons of Bela (1 Chr. 8:7, RV). 
<li>In AV (KJV) called "Ahiah." One of the five sons of Jerahmeel, who was great-grandson of Judah (1 Chr. 2:25). 
<li>Son of Ahitub (1 Sam. 14:3, 18), Ichabod's brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was high priest at Nob in the reign of Saul (1 Sam. 22:11). Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.
<li>A Pelonite, one of David's heroes (1 Chr. 11:36); called also Eliam (2 Sam. 23:34). 
<li>A Levite having charge of the sacred treasury in the temple (1 Chr. 26:20). 
<li>One of Solomon's secretaries (1 Kings 4:3).
</ul>
<p>
The same logic of theophoric names that give rise to the confusion about Isaiah 9:5-6 would also concluded that these men were the literal brother of YHWH.
<p>
<i>Virgin Births and Greek Theology</i>
<p>
As for the virgin birth - why did the Christians manufacture a prophecy about a virgin birth? Something that is not required of the Messiah? If not a simple mistranslation, 
then maybe something else. When the Jews didn't accept Jesus as the Messiah (because the many preconditions for the Messianic era had not been fulfilled), the Church 
faced the real threat that non-Jews would reject him too. So Paul did two things: He issued an order that said that a Christian no longer had to observe Jewish laws 
(Acts 15), and he introduced a few pagan myths into the new Christian religion so that it would appeal to the pagan gentiles. One such myth concerned the god Attis, 
who was worshiped in Western Asia (where Paul actively preached). According to The Golden Bough, by Frazier, Attis was born from a virgin. He later was mutilated 
and bled to death. The worship of Attis involved an effigy of him that was hung. Afterwards it would be buried in a cave, and when the tomb was reopened, the god 
Attis would rise from the dead and softly whisper glad tidings of salvation. In the Roman worship of Attis, an animal's blood, symbolic of the blood of Attis, would 
be poured on worshipers. They believed that his blood would wash away the worshipers sins. (Like Early Christians, worshipers of Attis also practiced celibacy). 
The two religions are so close that it cannot be a coincidence. Rather, Paul introduced these ideas into the worship of Jesus. Hence, he had to manufacture in 
Tanakh a prophecy that the Messiah would be immaculately conceived.

<p>
<i>Psalm 110:1</i>
<p>
In Matthew 22:41-44, there is a reported conversation between Jesus and the Pharisees concerning the genealogy of the Messiah. The Pharisees said that the Messiah 
will be the son of David, and Jesus reportedly counted: "'How then does David in the spirit call him 'Lord,' saying: 'The Lord said to my Lord, <i>"Sit at My right 
hand, till I make your enemies your footstool"</i>? If David then called him Lord, how is he his son?' And no one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man from 
that day forth ask him any more questions." This conversation could not have happened! Matthew is referring to Psalm 110:1, and is based on a clear mistranslation.
<p> 
The first "Lord" in the sentence is properly capitalized because it uses the four-letter Hebrew name for G-d, the Yud kay vav kay - 
<a href="../images/YHWH pronunciation.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/yhwh.png" width="50" height="30"></a>... YHWH. We would pronounce that in prayer 
as "Adonai," which means Lord and only applies to G-d. The second "Lord" is improperly capitalized because the Hebrew word used at that point is "adoni" which means 
"my lord" and only refers to a human. So  Psalm 110:1 should read: "The Lord said unto my lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." 
So who is the second and lower-cased "lord"? King David. This psalm begins "LeDavid Mizmor" (A song to David as opposed to by David). Accordingly, the song is 
written for David and makes him the subject of the first sentence. With that knowledge, the rest of the psalm makes perfect sense, G-d is giving much needed comfort 
to the King of Israel. Alternatively, it can be understood as a psalm written by David to be sung by the Levite choir praising him after his death.
<p>
Certainly any Pharisee would have known the meaning of Psalm 110 and would not have been confused by "Adonai" versus "adoni". It is not so clear that a Greek-educated 
story teller with little or no Jewish training, and a Christian axe to grind, would have been so knowledgeable. The story in Matthew then must be made up and judged 
self-serving.
<p>
Yet despite the obvious mistranslation, Psalm 110:1, continues to be misused by missionaries to prove that the Messiah sits at G-d's right hand and is like G-d. 
Judaism, however, believes that the Messiah is a human being, not a god.
<p>
It should be noted, however, that in the <a href="nt.php#lxx">LXX</a> (the Greek version of the Tanakh used by Christians) Psalm 110 uses the Greek word for "lord" (kurios) twice instead of once. 

<p>
<span class="section">True Redemption</span>
<p>
For Jews, if the Tanakh's requirements for the messiah have not been fulfilled, then there can only be one explanation: he has not yet come. To Jews, who were 
often subjected to mockery and contempt when asked where their messiah was, this was a painful statement to make. But it was inescapable. As our forefather's 
said: <i>Ani M'amin</i>: "I believe with complete faith in the coming of the messiah; and though he may tarry I shall wait for him every day."

<p>
Furthermore, Christianity contradicts Jewish theology. In Christianity, the notion of "Trinity" breaks G-d into three separate beings: The Father, the Son and the 
Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). However, the basis of Jewish belief is captured in the Shema: "Hear O Israel, the Lord our G-d, the Lord is ONE" (Deut. 6:4). Jews 
declare the One-ness of G-d every day, writing it on doorposts (Mezuzah), and binding it to the hand and head (Tefillin). This statement of G-d's One-ness is the 
first words a Jewish child is taught to say, and the last words uttered before he dies. In Jewish law, worship of a three-part G-d is considered idolatry -- one 
of the three cardinal sins which a Jew should rather give up his life than transgress. This explains why during the Inquisitions and throughout history, Jews gave 
up their lives rather than convert.

<p>
Furthermore, Christians believe that G-d came down to earth in human form, as Jesus said: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). However, in Judaism, the 
fundamental idea is that G-d is Incorporial, meaning G-d has no physical form. In Judaism, G-d is Eternal, above time, Infinite, beyond space. G-d cannot be born, 
and cannot die. Saying that G-d assumes human form makes G-d small, diminishing both G-d's Unity and Divinity. The Torah says: "G-d is not a mortal" (Numbers 23:19). 
Judaism says that the Messiah will be born of human parents, with normal physical attributes just like other people. He will not be a demigod, and will not possess 
supernatural qualities. In fact, an individual is alive in every generation with the capacity to step into the role of the Messiah. (Maimonides - Laws of Kings 11:3)

<p>
Lastly, in Christianity, the <i>physical world is viewed as an evil to be avoided</i>. Mary is portrayed as a virgin. Priests and nuns are celibate. Monasteries 
are in remote, secluded locations. In Judaism, the belief is that G-d created the physical world not to frustrate us, but for our pleasure. Jewish spirituality 
comes through grappling with the mundane world in a way that uplifts and elevates. Sex in the proper context is one of the holiest acts we can perform. The Talmud 
says if a person has the opportunity to taste a new fruit and refuses to do so, he will have to account for that in the World-to-Come. Jewish rabbinical schools 
teach how to live amidst the bustle of commercial activity. Jews don't retreat from life, we elevate it.

<p>
So what do Jews say about Jesus, if he wasn't the messiah. The historical Jesus (not the mangod Christianity made him into) accomplished a great deal in turning 
people away from idolatry and towards a more authentic knowledge of G-d. But he has no special role to Judaism, in fact, no role at all.
